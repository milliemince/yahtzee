## Using Markov Chains and Probabilistic Modeling to Play Yahtzee

### Files
```
markov-chain-yahtzee.tex
```

LaTex file describing how Markov Chain transition matrix probabilities were calculated as well as payoff/probability model used to determine the optimal move. Closes with a full turn example that outlines how code in "yahtzee5.jl" will determine and act on the optimal move.
