## Using Markov Chains and Probabilistic Modeling to Play Yahtzee

Hello Sarah hehe. You are the first to see my lil page here >:) 

In the upper right hand corner you'll see a blue rectangle linking to the GitHub folder with everything in it. The important files are described below (the others are helper files and whatnot). First look at the "PDF rendering" of "markov-chain-yahtzee.tex." Then you can use the blue button to go to my Github folder and click on "yahtzee5.jl" to see the code. Damnnnnn she so sexy with it!

### Desciption of Files

```
markov-chain-yahtzee.tex
```

LaTex file describing how Markov Chain transition matrix probabilities were calculated as well as the payoff/probability model used to determine the optimal move. Closes with a full turn example that outlines how code in "yahtzee5.jl" will determine and act on the optimal move.



```
Using_Markov_Chains_And_Probabilistic_Modeling_To_Play_Yahtzee.pdf
```

[PDF rendering](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y5hUx9HHLH6KYypKV3E5pVbmhkAhsKf0/view?usp=sharing) of ```markov-chain-yahtzee.tex```. This document is very important in understanding how Markov Chains function in this analysis as well as the fundamentals of the Yahtzee strategy.



```
yahtzee5.jl
```
Written in Julia, executes strategy described in ```Using_Markov_Chains_And_Probabilistic_Modeling_To_Play_Yahtzee.pdf```
